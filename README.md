# DaasaVaani Library

Bootstrap for reviewed, flat per-video Markdown, catalog registries/configuration,
source assets, ingestion/import implementation, source validation and a future
Node/TypeScript content publisher with tests. Planned direct roots are `library/`,
`registries/`, `settings/`, `assets/`, `tools/`, `shared/`, `docs/` and `.github/`.
Content and application files have not been migrated or generated.

[Shared](https://github.com/DaasaVaani/shared) is pinned at `shared/` as a
language-neutral source dependency, not a shared application runtime. Website,
Android and Library update their pins independently; there are no lockstep
updates. Shared owns schemas/specifications and the UI catalog generator/
committed resources. Exact schemas and implementation remain pending.

The [approved implementation-design record](https://github.com/DaasaVaani/shared/blob/main/docs/implementation-specification.md)
documents the earlier review passes and remaining gates. All configurable
catalog/import/image/publisher values belong in Library settings, portable
profiles/search policy in Shared settings; no hardcoded defaults.

The eventual **generated-only** Pages publication is
<https://daasavaani.github.io/library/>, independently deployed from the
[Website](https://daasavaani.github.io/). Capacity validation is still open.
No deployment is configured here; Website has no Library Git-source dependency.

## Source review and contribution

Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DaasaVaani/library.git`,
or run `git submodule update --init` after cloning. Use the issue forms and PR
template; get approval before resolving open design choices.

Source PRs contain canonical Kannada, supplied Source Latin and metadata, not
generated lyric variants/previews or companion source files. Generate actual
variants only after merge. Fixture and tooling checks are allowed in source PRs.
Preserve reviewed corrections, verse structure and identity; transliterate,
never translate. Keep uncertain content as drafts, not fabricated lyrics.
Generated-text fixes belong in global rules/profiles, never item/line overrides
or changes to correct Kannada solely to force conversion.

Review source permissions, attribution and required source assets/settings
together. Public availability is not redistribution permission. Keep private
permission correspondence, secrets and private data out of the repository.
Remote hosting retains only the current publication; safe old-version resume/
repair is not guaranteed. Hosting-limit/headroom preflight is required, with
actual capacity and planner limits still unmeasured.

## Approved publisher and ingestion boundaries

- First API ingestion is blocked pending provider retention/refresh clarification;
  the provisional official-API design is not compliance approval.
- Ingestion remains local/manual, with full uploads pagination, committed/pending
  reconciliation and sanitized console/machine/PR reports. No scheduled CI run,
  API secret in CI or direct-main ingestion.
- Valid incomplete drafts and complete items with publication-hold reasons are
  excluded; malformed sources/references fail validation. Blank separators are
  layout without lyric UUIDs.
- Publish five initial Latin profiles (Hunterian deferred), nine non-Latin
  renderings, raw Source Latin/status and snapshot-pinned policy. Exact reviewed
  mappings/aliases remain pending; no actual generated source-PR previews.
- Maintain first-publication/output-changed-at ledger and no-op identity/dates.
  Individual gzip objects plus common ZIP STORE reading bundles up to100/32MiB;
  images are separately fetched online. Oversized objects may transfer directly
  under their own limits.
- Deploy one complete validated public Pages artifact, not source roots or a
  promised descriptor-last/global-CDN-atomic update.

## Bootstrap validation

Run `python tools/check_repository.py` and `git diff --check` from this root.
CI also parses YAML syntax. These are repository-hygiene checks, not publisher
tests, source-schema validation or a security audit. Add npm updates and real
publisher checks only when actual manifests and implementation exist.
